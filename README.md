This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: passing an array to a function expecting a single string. The bug.ts file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.ts provides the corrected version. The error arises from a type mismatch between the function's expected parameter type and the argument's actual type.  The solution involves either modifying the function's parameter type or processing the array appropriately before passing it to the function.
